# Warehouse Project with OOP

Let us assume that you work for a Nike warehouse. As store manager you are responsible for stock taking.
Nike warehouses store the following information for each shoe item in a text file:
- Country
- Code
- Product
- Cost
- Quantity

Users (i.e. store managers) can use the program to do the following:
- capture new shoes to inventory
- view all shoes in inventory
- search shoes by code
- restock lowest quantity item
- show value for each item
- show highest quantity item

Installation:
Make sure you have the tabulate library installed by doing the following:
